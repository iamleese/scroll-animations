### Creating Scroll Sections

**Create a group block:**
Add a group block to your editor:

### Add an Animated Block
You can find the Animated Block under the "Design" category in your block menu. Add the block and drop whatever you need animated inside of the block.
Settings can be adjusted in the block menu.

## Advanced Usage

### Call Functions
Call functions can be found under the "Interactivity" panel. This will require some advanced knowledge of WordPress enqueuing and javascript.

**Create your javascript file:**


    //your_theme_file.js

    sayHello(){
        console.log("Hello!");
    }


**Enter the function name under the "Scroll Call" input:**

**Events and objects**

The event and object parameters are passed in each call. You can track the triggered event and the object 
information when the animation block comes in view.

    //your_theme_file.js

    sayHello(event,obj){
        console.log("Hello!");
        console.log(event);
        console.log(obj);
    }
